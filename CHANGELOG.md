# Change Log

All notable changes to the "Markdown Org" extension will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- Agenda views in week and month modes failed with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter')". `filterTasksByTag` now treats missing day buckets (`overdue`, `scheduled_timed`, `scheduled_no_time`, `upcoming`) as empty arrays instead of dereferencing `undefined.filter`, which matches the sparse shape that `markdown-org-extract` emits for these modes.
- Clicking a task in agenda no longer fails with "refused to open file outside workspace". The `openTask` handler now opens whatever path `markdown-org-extract` returned, which fixes navigation in setups that use symlinks, a `markdown-org.workspaceDir` outside `workspaceFolders`, or aggregate tasks from directories outside the VS Code workspace. The path guard remains in place for the user-configured `markdown-org.maintainFilePath` setting, where it actually prevents writes to system paths.
- Agenda commands now invoke `markdown-org-extract --absolute-paths`, so the file paths the extractor returns are openable directly. Without this, clicking a task tried to open `/file.md` at the filesystem root because VS Code resolved the relative path against the current working directory.
- Failures from `openTextDocument` (e.g. the file is gone) are now surfaced via an error message instead of silently dropping the click, so the agenda no longer "does nothing" when the task can't be opened.

### Internal

- `agenda.ts` now uses the same `exec.execFile` wrapper as the other commands, so the four `Show Agenda *` / `Show Tasks` commands can be exercised in integration tests.
- Added `agenda.integration.test.ts` covering each of the four show\* commands and a Day → Week → Month → Tasks switch. The week/month payloads intentionally omit some day buckets to lock the v0.3.0 regression in.
- Extracted `AgendaPanel.openTaskInEditor` so the openTask flow can be exercised from tests, and added cases for files outside `workspaceFolders`, symlinked files, and missing files.
- Replaced the tautological `panels.length >= 0` assertion in `monthView.integration.test.ts` with a check that `vscode.window.showErrorMessage` was never invoked.
- `.vscodeignore` excludes `CLAUDE.md` so the marketplace VSIX stays free of project-internal AI rules.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- New setting `markdown-org.firstDayOfWeek` (`"monday"` | `"sunday"` | `"auto"`) controlling the first day of week in the month calendar. `"auto"` uses the locale's default via `Intl.Locale.weekInfo`.
- Mode switcher inside the agenda webview: Day / Week / Month / Tasks buttons in the navigation bar; the panel title updates when the active mode changes.
- Other-month cells in the month calendar are now clickable and navigate to the corresponding day.

### Changed

- **Tag filter semantics reworked.** Patterns are now matched against `path.basename(file)` instead of the full path, so `"work"` no longer accidentally matches files inside a `networking/` directory. An empty pattern always means "show everything" regardless of the tag's name (the previous special-case for the literal name `ALL` is gone). A `!`-prefixed pattern means "does not match any positive pattern in `fileTags`" — the text after `!` is only a marker and is ignored.
- `markdown-org.currentTag` is now persisted at workspace scope when a workspace is open (was: always global), so different projects can keep different active tags.
- Month calendar rendering:
    - Target month is derived from the navigation date, not from the first entry in the agenda data, so empty months and back/forward navigation render correctly.
    - Weekday headers are localized via `toLocaleDateString` instead of hardcoded English `Mon`/`Tue`/…
    - The grid now adapts to 4–6 rows depending on the month's length instead of always rendering 6 rows.
    - Tasks marked as overdue now contribute to the day's "has tasks" indicator.
- Documented tag filter semantics in [TAG_FILTERING.md](TAG_FILTERING.md) and README.

### Fixed

- Re-running `Show Agenda (Day/Week/Month)` or `Show Tasks` on an already-open agenda panel now correctly switches the mode instead of being ignored.
- Calendar no longer crashes on an empty `days[]` array.

### Internal

- Extracted the tag filter into `src/utils/tagFilter.ts` so it can be unit-tested without the `vscode` runtime.
- Added unit tests for `filterTasksByTag` covering basename matching, negation symmetry, empty-pattern semantics, unknown-tag fallback, and per-day data shape.
- Extended integration tests for `cycleTag`: workspace-scope persistence, recovery from an unknown current tag, and the empty-`fileTags` warning path.
- Removed dead static fields `AgendaPanel.currentMode` and `AgendaPanel.currentTag`; renamed `AgendaPanel.refreshWithCurrentTag()` to `refresh()`.
- Wrapped `child_process.execFile` in `src/utils/exec.ts` so it can be stubbed in tests without redefining the non-configurable `cp.execFile` descriptor in newer Node.
